CALENDAR(1)                 General Commands Manual                CALENDAR(1)



NAME
       calendar - print upcoming events

SYNOPSIS
       calendar [-d] [-A num] [-B num] [-t [[[cc]yy]mm]dd] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       calendar reads the standard input, or the named files, for events, one
       event per line; and write to standard output those events beginning
       with either today's date or tomorrow's.  On Fridays and Saturdays,
       events through Monday are printed.

       The options are as follows:

       -A num Print lines from today and next num days (forward, future).

       -B num Print lines from today and previous num days (backward, past).

       -d     Rather than print the date on the same line of each event, print
              the date alone in a line and followed by each event indented
              with a tab.

       -t[[yyyy]mm]dd
              Act like the specified value is “today” instead of using the
              current date.

       Each read line should begin with a date pattern in the format
       [[YYYY-[MM]]-DD.  The hyphen (-) that separates the values can be
       replaced by a slash (/) or a period (.).

       YYYY should be any year number.  MM should be a month number or a month
       name (either complete or abbreviate, such as "April" or "Apr").  DD
       should be the number of a day in the month or the name of a day in the
       week (either complete or abbreviate).

       If DD is the name of a day in the week, it can be followed by +N or -N
       to specify the week on the month (for example Sun+2 is the second
       Sunday in the month, Mon-3 is the third from last Monday in the month).

EXAMPLES
       Consider the following input.

              # holidays
              01-01      New Year's day
              05-01      Labor Day
              07-25      Generic holiday
              12-25      Christmas
              May-Sun+2  Mother's day

       If today were 09 March 2021, then running calendar with the options -d
       and -A7 on this input would print the following:

              Sunday     09 May 09
                      Mother's day
              Monday     10 May 10

STANDARDS
       The calendar program previously selected lines which had the correct
       date anywhere in the line.  This is no longer true: the date is only
       recognized when it occurs at the beginning of a line.

       The calendar program previously read events from a file called calendar
       in the current directory or in a specified directory.  This is no
       longer true: it reads the events from the standard input or from the
       named files.  This new behavior makes calendar more scriptable (it can
       be used in a shell pipeline, for example).

       The calendar program previously had an option to send a mail to all
       users.  This is no longer true.  To have your calendar mailed to you
       every day, use cron(8).

HISTORY
       A calendar command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
