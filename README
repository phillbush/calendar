CALENDAR(1)                 General Commands Manual                CALENDAR(1)



NAME
       calendar - print upcoming events

SYNOPSIS
       calendar [-l] [-A num] [-B num] [-t [[yyyy]mm]dd] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       calendar reads the named files for events, one event per line; and
       write to standard output those events beginning with either today's
       date or tomorrow's.  On Fridays and Saturdays, events through Monday
       are printed.  If a hyphen (-) is provided as argument, calendar reads
       from the standard input.  If no file is provided as argument, calendar
       reads the file named calendar on the current directory or on the
       directory specified by the CALENDAR_DIR environment variable.

       The options are as follows:

       -A num Print lines from today and next num days (forward, future).

       -B num Print lines from today and previous num days (backward, past).

       -l     Rather than print the date on the same line of each event, print
              the date alone in a line and followed by each event indented
              with a tab.

       -t[[yyyy]mm]dd
              Act like the specified value is “today” instead of using the
              current date.

       Each event should begin with a date pattern in the format
       [[YYYY-[MM]]-DDWW[+N|-N] or should be the name of a movable fest, such
       as easter.  The hyphen (-) that separates the values can be replaced by
       a slash (/) or a period (.).  Several date patterns can be supplied
       separated by a comma (,).

       YYYY should be any year number.  MM should be a month number or a month
       name (either complete or abbreviate, such as "April" or "Apr").  DD
       should be the number of a day in the month.  WW should be the name of a
       day in the week (either complete or abbreviate).  Either DD or WW (or
       both) must be supplied.

       The date pattern can be followed by +N or -N to specify the week on the
       month (for example Sun+2 is the second Sunday in the month, Mon-3 is
       the third from last Monday in the month).

EXAMPLES
       Consider the following input.

              # holidays
              01/01      New Year's day
              05/01      Labor Day
              07/25      Generic holiday
              12/25      Christmas
              May/Sun+2  Mother's day
              13Fri      Friday the 13th

       If today were 09 March 2021, then running calendar with the options -l
       and -A7 on this input would print the following:

              Sunday     09 May 09
                      Mother's day
              Monday     10 May 10

STANDARDS
       The calendar program previously selected lines which had the correct
       date anywhere in the line.  This is no longer true: the date is only
       recognized when it occurs at the beginning of a line.

       The calendar program previously could interpret only one date for each
       event.  This is no longer true: each event can occur in more than one
       date (see the examples for the classes above).

       The calendar program previously could not read events from the standard
       input.  This is no longer true: if the argument is a hyphen (-), events
       are read from the standard input.

       The calendar program previously had an option to send a mail to all
       users.  This is no longer true.  To have your calendar mailed every
       day, use cron(8).

HISTORY
       A calendar command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
